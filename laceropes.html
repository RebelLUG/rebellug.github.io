                            <p style="text-align: center;">The Laceropes Mission is an original Star Wars story by RebelLUG like no other LEGO collaboration project before. It is proudly sponsored by <a href="https://avfigures.com">AV Figures</a>, who helped us create Validus Squad, a four member clone squad of completly custom LEGO minifigures. The squad is available for purchase in limited quantites from AV Figures. This collaboration was premiered at Brickworld Chicago 2019 and released online on June 22nd, 2019.</p>

The Republic’s campaign on Laceropes has been underway for over two standard weeks and we’re headed to their base, located in a small town in what seems to be the remains of a temple. The mission summary stated the natives of Laceropes, groups of monks, had different factions defending them in this conflict. It’s believed that a Republic admiral, Admiral Oris Ski, was captured by a group of native allies and he’s potentially being tortured for information. Our mission is to bring him home or find out if he was killed.”</p>

We’ll need to keep extreme cover throughout our probe, so we have quite a long walk ahead of us. The reason for this campaign has become more apparent as we’ve traveled. These lacertosus crystals are everywhere, mostly located in ravines that run like veins across the planet’s surface. Chancellor Palpatine personally made it clear that mining them and the taking control of the planet’s capitol was necessary to the war effort. We were cleared to execute natives under any circumstances.”</p>
