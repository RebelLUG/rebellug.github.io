				<div class="paragraph">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although none of us really pride ourselves on being BrickLinkers or LEGO investors, and most of the readers are here looking for extra tips on building custom MOCs, it&rsquo;s an interesting enough topic to at least drop in a few words on: LEGO investing; interesting enough to even be featured out in the mainstream media like <a href="http://time.com/money/4162059/lego-investment-compare-gold-return/" target="_blank">Time Magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-01-06/legos-a-better-investment-than-gold" target="_blank">US News</a>.<br />The angle they take is about LEGO being a better investment than gold, which people buy into for security of monetary value or increased value in time. That increase being roughly 9.6% each year since 2000. But in the last 16 years, average LEGO sets kept in new, sealed condition have increased by around 12% annually. And that&rsquo;s just average LEGO sets of any variety, if investors play their cards right, numbers upwards of 36% annual gain are being tossed around. An example of this is the much sought after Star Wars Ultimate Collectors Series Millennium Falcon from 2007, which had an original price tag of $510. Now buyers looking a product in the 2007-like LEGO store condition are staring up at a $4,250 set-back.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming you&rsquo;re still reading and not rushing to BrickLink to confirm some of these numbers, you&rsquo;re at least interesting in learning more about either short or long term LEGO investing. Notice the part where I said, if you play your cards right, earlier. There are simple ways to make investments, like picking up good deals and turning them over later, or picking up sets that are about to be real popular since their movie is on its way. But when it gets complicated is when you need to predict the sets that stand the test of time, and are still demanded years past discontinuation.<br />Unless it&rsquo;s in your buffer of cash you&rsquo;re ready to give up for a long time, I do not recommend investing in LEGO, especially this way. There is no guarantee of the return you&rsquo;re hoping for, and you&rsquo;ll be out for quite a while<br />Chances are if you&rsquo;re delving into this RebelLUG blog, you&rsquo;re a member of the LEGO online community, and you watch as everything goes down. You keep pace with other fans, and understand the hobby enough. This is where you have to watch for patterns. Look at what&rsquo;s popular among the real fans, and what isn&rsquo;t. Another indicator is how frequent the sales are and how long they last. If a vendor leaves a big LEGO set on 20% for an extended period of time, and it doesn&rsquo;t get sold out, there&rsquo;s no way it&rsquo;s going to be super-hot on the aftermarket.<br />But that&rsquo;s the beauty of all LEGO. Whether it&rsquo;s new or used, in parts or in a set, it always manages to at least retain value. So for us as casual builders or set collectors, were actually making micro investments on a daily basis, which some day (hopefully not) we will take back our piece plunge.<br /><br />Till the Next Post,<br />Spencer<br /><br />Sources:<br />&#8203;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/lego-a-better-investment-than-shares-and-gold/</div>

Although my knowledge isn&rsquo;t on par with masters of clickbait and Internet manipulists, I&rsquo;m going to throw in my two cents.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Upon finally finishing your incredible build, it&rsquo;s understandable how antsy one can be to post to the world wide web. Once you&rsquo;ve taken some &lsquo;meh&rsquo; photos, maybe a video, and drop them on social media you go to sleep or standby waiting to comments to roll in. But trust me, waiting it out and putting in proper effort is easily worth the wait of an extra day. I&rsquo;ve personally seen great work essentially go down the drain simply due to rushing out a garbage video and quickly taking poor photos. After making loads of MOCs I understand the effort required in the final stage, being the video.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I finished the Death Trooper helmet MOC some time in the evening of a Friday night. Over the next few hours I cleaned and prepared my room to film the video before starting around 10 PM. Even though I was working as hard as I could and it only turned out to be a 2 minute long showcase, only around 3 AM did I complete the work with the camera. Editing lasted till 8 AM, with the timestamp on the publishing reading &ldquo;8:35 AM.&rdquo; Keep in mind this still includes taking a nice thumbnail picture and photos for Flickr. At the time it was a ton of work, but looking back, it was worth it. I very much like the result and based on the response, folks enjoyed not only the MOC, but the video also.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Everyone has their own style and of course I&rsquo;m not telling you to pull an all nighter to complete a video for your channel, but as long as the visual quality is there to present your build and entertain the masses, you can move on to step two.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">There are so many places you can post this newly completed masterpiece of yours, where to start? Begin with your initial platform of choice: your homebase. For example, mine is YouTube; Flickr, Instagram, and Reddit all redirect and support my YouTube. Once that jumping off point has been established, you can, in essence, spam all platforms on the face of the Internet, although it may not be totally necessary. While I only use the aforementioned places because of the large pre-existing communities residing on them, there are even more options. Other RebelLUG members browse Facebook, MOCPages, and even Twitter for new builds.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The hardest part however is finding and being found by the community of LEGO people hiding on these social media sites. To solve this problem, many such as Flickr or Facebook have group features where the ecosystem is much smaller and all fellow LEGO fans. Not only will this help you find cool MOCs, it subsequently leads other enthusiasts to you.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Now that all those other social medias are pointing towards on primary place where you choose to call home, it&rsquo;ll be able to grow. Of course there&rsquo;s no single formula, but I hope this helps you find a starting point if you&rsquo;re still looking for it.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Till the next post,</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Spencer</span></span><br /><br />&#8203;</div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;For almost all &ldquo;enthusiast&rdquo; LEGO builders, sorting all those little bricks can be the bane of your existence. So today I am here to tell you all my suggestions for when it comes to how your should sort your LEGO.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I&rsquo;ve got a lot of organizing to do right now from my last few MOCs, so I thought it would be appropriate to kickoff my Collection Series with a video about sorting. I think everyone who enjoys building should have their pieces organized so, today we&rsquo;re going to go over all the different reasons why you would want to sort in different ways, and why I sort the way I do. Without any further ado, let&rsquo;s begin.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In my eyes, there are 2 different extremes when it comes to sorting: by color or by piece. And everything in between. Everyone basically falls in that in between. How you do it is determined by the following factors: how/what you build, the state of your collection, how often you use different pieces, and how much effort you&rsquo;re willing to put in. You want to put in some time and use these to decide how you should categorize all your parts. After that, of course you&rsquo;ll need somewhere to store them, which I will have a video on a little later.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">What do these different things really mean, and how should they affect how you sort? First of all, how/what you build. We all build differently, how we come up with designs and such. And I&rsquo;m sure there's a wide variety of people who build different themes in the audience right now. So that means there&rsquo;s no one way to sort. You should atune it to your needs.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">My light gray is a good example. First of all, it&rsquo;s sorted into a LOT of different categories, because I probably use it more than anything. The first few being different sized bricks and plates. I like to have the bricks and plates sorted out for almost all the colors because those are more usually structural parts, and I don't want to dig to find all of them. Then I have 2 bins for sort of all the random parts, minus all the specific things that are taken out.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">When I go to make something, I really have no idea what I&rsquo;m going to do. So having all of these pieces right in front of me is super helpful when it comes to experimenting and finding a design. I usually know the size of what I&rsquo;m making, so I have a bin for 4x4 and below random parts. And then everything bigger. Then a lot of the things I use frequently, I have completely sorted out. That can mean a specific part, or a type of part. For example, I use a lot of jumpers, technic bricks, and hinges, so I have all of those taken out of every color. When a kind of part is sorted, it usually overrides color.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Now I know a lot of people that would prefer to sort by piece over color. I sort of do both, but they really just like to do it by piece. This is because of how they build. I&rsquo;ve noticed that these people usually have an idea before going into making something. They also tend to design things, then buy parts in whatever color they need it in. I personally don&rsquo;t like to do that, so I sort by color so that I can make it in the right color the first time.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">This brings me well into the state of your collection. If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of pieces in whatever color, you might not want to sort by just that color. That might mean that you like to design then order the right color.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;How often you use pieces is pretty obvious. I kind of already went over this, and I&rsquo;m sure you can figure it out, but I&rsquo;ll give another example. I sort my grey plates out more than say my yellow ones, because of how often I use them. This can also be applied to how much you have of them, or the state of your collection. </span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Finally, how much effort you&rsquo;re willing to put in. I&rsquo;ll get into this a lot more next episode when I talk about all the reasons why you would want to sort out your LEGO piece collection if you&rsquo;re a builder, but it essentially means taking all the time to just do it right. None of this means anything if you just sort it by color and call it a day, when it really isn&rsquo;t optimal for you as a builder.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Anyway, for those who made it through the whole article, I hope I was able to give you some tips if you were in need. Thanks for reading.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Till the next post,</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Spencer</span></span></div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Two years or so ago I figured it out. I found an easy(ish) way to always have a nice gift ready for anyone around the holidays or as a birthday present. The answer, at least for us builders, is LEGO! Using your creativity you can design something small yet neat and then order the parts to make a solid handful of your MOC for all your friends and family.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Of course depending on who the gift may be for some small creation may not suffice, but for those estranged aunts and uncles it&rsquo;ll do the job well. For the last three Christmases I&rsquo;ve designed a holiday related LEGO ornament and gifted it to all the folks closest to me. After finishing the model, I turn to Bricklink for the parts to make five to ten, mostly depending on how hard the parts are to come by.</span></span><br /></div>  <div><div style="height: 20px; overflow: hidden;"></div> 				<div id='756283008650378238-gallery' class='imageGallery' style='line-height: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0'>

I actually still really like this model, the techniques in it are particularly compact. Plus all the parts are pretty common and cheap.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The next year&rsquo;s was inspired by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eilonwy77/" target="_blank">Katie Walker</a> on Flickr, who had some beautiful, little mosaics of holiday images that I basically encased in glass and put a hook on. These looked really cool, and I even made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKVoU2aV1as" target="_blank">video</a>, but all the transparent colored cheese slopes were on the expensive side.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">And last year, 2016, I took some inspiration from <a href="http://chrismcveigh.com/cm/welcome.html" target="_blank">Chris McVeigh</a>&rsquo;s Santa ornament and made my own, which in the end looks quite a bit different. This final design I was super happy with. It was easy to make, relatively cheap, looked nice, and for my own amusement, had some creative parts usage.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">But before gifting a LEGO model, whether it be an ornament or a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/legospencer11/30080613481/in/dateposted-public/" target="_blank">friend&rsquo;s dog</a>, there are some preparations to be made. Usually the pieces I&rsquo;m building them out of are new from Bricklink and I just keep the original design for myself, but if the parts are coming from your bins and some may be discolored or dirty, I would wash them or even soak them in hydrogen peroxide. Then, a step some readers may absolutely despise: glue them. I understand you may not want your LEGO glued, but the person on the receiving end would love the security of knowing their gift won&rsquo;t break from any fall or mishandling.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I think this is a must. Go out, buy a small bottle of Krazy Glue and take the few minutes to glue the builds. Although the glue is supposed to be invisible, it really shows up on the shiny LEGO parts, so I would recommend disassembling a little to try and lather glue where it can&rsquo;t be seen, but will get the job done.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Anyway, I hope this helps you in your endeavors to find gifts for all those great people in your life. If you have any questions leave them in the comments below. Thanks for reading.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Till the next post,</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Spencer</span></span></div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"></span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;Prior we discussed how to actually sort all your plastic bricks lying about in an attempt to make them logically organized; now, we can move on to options for actually storing them. All the different methods&rsquo; pros and cons that I at least am aware of and have used.</span></span><br /><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;Which method you use essentially comes down to two things: how much you want to spend on storage and the state of your collection. The state of your collection in this case being how much you have of in the different categories, and how much you want to sort it out.</span></span><br /><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;You basically need to get storage accordingly to how you&rsquo;re going to sort your collection. Not only have I sorted certain parts of my collection out heavily, I've got a lot of things from Pick a Brick or Bricklink where there's individual parts in decent quantities, and I don't want to throw them in one of the big general bins. So I need some smaller drawers to put those in, and usually a lot of them. But I also have some categories that are much larger, like my dark grey slopes, thus I need some bigger drawers for those. Then of course all the ones in between.</span></span><br /><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;You may have come to this conclusion through what I just said, but what I would recommend if a variety of storage compartment sizes. How much you get of the different sizes, like these big ones, medium ones, and really small ones, is totally down to your collection and how many parts you have and how much you&rsquo;re sorting it out.</span></span><br /><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;There are some different methods of storage that I'm going to share with you. The first being what I consider the best and most convenient: drawers. Now they are also probably the most expensive, but I think it&rsquo;s worth it. The cheaper methods could include plastic bags. These are a big hassle most of the time, if you do choose these I would recommend tacking them to a board so you can see all of them, like Kris Productions. Another is toates, which can be found at the dollar store. These are usually a hassle, but I still have a few around for extra storage of whatever. One last thing to consider as part of your storage solution is PAB cups if you get those a lot, they can be really helpful for single things you have a lot of.</span></span><br /><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;I get asked all the time &ldquo;What should I sort my parts in, or where do I you get your drawers&rdquo; and such. There really isn&rsquo;t one single place to go get drawers from. Most of the time it&rsquo;s just down to the situation. If you see a good deal, get those. I&rsquo;m sure lots of places around you sell different kinds of drawers. I got these bigger white ones from Target, and the stack-ons at Lowes. These I got for a dollar each at a closing hallmark, and these were at a yard sale. I even use shoe boxes for some things.</span></span><br /><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the end it just comes down to a lot of variety in your choices for drawers, and how much you get of the different types comes down to how much of the different categories you have and how much you&rsquo;re going to sort.</span></span><br /><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;If someone is looking for a place to store their parts, redirect them here. If you&rsquo;ve got anything to add, let me know down in the comments so anyone else browsing the article will see also. Thanks for reading, hope it was worth it!</span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Till the next post,</span></span><br /><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Spencer</span></span><br /><span></span><br /></div>

If you can&rsquo;t already tell, I&rsquo;m not allowed to talk about what exactly the build is just yet. Hopefully at some point you will find out. Anyway, the fact that I can&rsquo;t find any inspiration to work some something seemingly simple isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;m writing about. Last weekend I tried getting the wheels turning on this MOC, but almost as soon as I begun I ran square into a huge roadblock.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">One of the most familiar building techniques to almost all builders is one that is actually considered &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; by LEGO because of how it stresses the bricks, so they won&rsquo;t use it in any sets or products meant to last. Despite that thousands of builders have made curved walls out of staggered 1x2 bricks, which have just enough leeway to flex and essentially create curves out of bricks.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/legospencer11/21557662750/in/dateposted-public/" target="_blank"> &nbsp;</a></span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/legospencer11/21557662750/in/dateposted-public/" target="_blank">I&rsquo;ve done this</a> many times myself with a variety of different bricks. You can only bend/flex the 1x2 bricks so far before the wall of them basically just snaps and you have to reconnect it and try again. The build I&rsquo;m working on is predominantly dark red and requires this curving technique for some of the walls, out of dark red. I had some dark red 1x2&rsquo;s back from Pick-A-Brick over 5 years ago. I began constructing a wall out of them, and once I had a decent length I went on to bend it to my desired radius. Which, keep in mind, isn&rsquo;t actually a very tight curve, especially compared to what I, and others, have achieved. Upon arching it a reasonable distance, just about where I need it, I heard some strange cracks and creaks coming from the bricks. Different than normal. Although I knew something wasn&rsquo;t right I cared on and bent it slightly further, knowing that the worst that could happen is it snaps apart and I put it back together.</span></span></div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>  <span class='imgPusher' style='float:left;height:423px'></span><span style='display: table;width:377px;position:relative;float:left;max-width:100%;;clear:left;margin-top:20px;*margin-top:40px'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/BQJaTyJjd3n/?taken-by=alcloneproductions' target='_blank'><img src="../../uploads/8/2/1/0/82101198/published/anders-bend4f3b.png?1486965912" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0; max-width:100%" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder wsite-image" /></a><span style="display: table-caption; caption-side: bottom; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;" class="wsite-caption"></span></span> <div class="paragraph" style="display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Instead, at one single point, the wall completely snapped. Once I picked up the remnants it was clear what I had gone wrong: multiple pieces in that one spot had broken under the minimal stress. This is very strange for LEGO as quality has always been a priority, and bricks without an easy breaking point can&rsquo;t be easily &ldquo;snapped.&rdquo; Continuing to experiment I reconnected the 1x2 bricks and tried again: same exact result. Throughout this process I actually ended up damaging a plethora more of a bricks that simply didn&rsquo;t collapse the entire wall with them.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><font color="#000000">My frustration reminded me of other times LEGO pieces had failed me, say under the pressure of a brick separator&nbsp;or whatever. But for some reason I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking there was an anomaly in the frequency of broken dark red pieces in the past, even though it&rsquo;s nowhere near my most used color. Since I&rsquo;m always looking to spark a discussion I took to social media asking if anyone else had experienced the same thing. On both Flickr and Instagram I got the same responses, which matched up with my story. Quite a few comments also mentioned the same problem with reddish brown, a very similar looking color.</font></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I went to Google looking for any forum thread or post with any mention of the issue but came up mostly dry. The only <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/30439-lego-quality-reference/" target="_blank">relevant article</a> is from Eurobricks user CP5670, showing when certain LEGO colors were changed. A reply from Svelte states that some time in 2009 the dark red color was changed to be more consistent from batch to batch, which resulted in it having a noticeably more brown tinge, the only other reported color to be having issues.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">At this point it sounds like I&rsquo;m trying to start a conspiracy theory about brown-ish dark red bricks and reddish-brown bricks and how they&rsquo;re the only ones known to be so brittle under pressure. Since then the problem was probably noticed by LEGO and fixed, proven by Anders from AlCloneProductions who decided to try it for himself with his dark red bricks, completing an incredible curve without them breaking or even snapping apart. As Sean Edmison puts it on my Flickr post, &ldquo;Let this stand as a warning to anyone who thinks that all bricks are created equal.&rdquo;</span></span><br /><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Till the next post,</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Spencer</span></span><br />&#8203;</div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>  <div class="wsite-spacer" style="height:50px;"></div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Previously I talked about the process of searching for deals online when looking for LEGO, whether it be sets or parts. In this part two the topic continues except instead for the real world. There&rsquo;s a handful of methods for both new and used brick floating around out there, and with what I at least know, I&rsquo;ve thrown together a list. I would also recommend reading part one before this one.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;I mentioned something along the lines of looking for deals to retailers&rsquo; online stores and how it was really the same as their brick and mortar facilities and I would touch on it a lot more here. Of course there are coupon catalogs from Walmart or Toys R Us that let you see some of the things going down (in price) on the shelves, but where the best deals come from are the hidden/unannounced clearances. This is more or less what people come across while shopping if it isn&rsquo;t announced by the store at some point. The only thing fast enough to find out about these incredible deals on LEGO sets is of course the Internet. There is a plethora of websites with the sole purpose of relaying LEGO steals around the world. Some times they apply only online to where I just bought from the other day, </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">barnesandnoble.com,</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> or just in physical locations.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;I keep a handful just sitting on my bookmarks as a reminder to check them frequently just in case a good investment pops up. Although I can&rsquo;t list them all and if you look hard enough you&rsquo;ll probably find some favorites of your own, some of my favorites for the United States include neoape, BrickSet, Toysnbricks, TheBrickFan, and on occasion the Brothers Brick.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;For those on the look for massive amounts of bulk brick, I have a method that has served me personally extremely well a few times. A large majority of folks reading this article are bound to have heard or used Craigslist or Kajiji at some point. Looking for local ads and bargaining for sets or parts is a great way to score an awesome deal. Also don&rsquo;t forget that posting ads looking for LEGO is an option, which is where I got one of my best deals; I had someone coming to me. Instead of paying the going rate for most retired sets, there&rsquo;s potential to offer a significant portion less since the odds are the ad is for a bunch. When it comes to miscellaneous used (probably gross) pieces, I don&rsquo;t go above $3 a pound. Even though it&rsquo;s just asking to get called out for low balling an offer, that&rsquo;s where I stand.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;The same logic goes for yard sale buys. Those you just have to get out and really look for. Especially since so many others are going to be on the prowl for LEGO, since its value has been deemed so impeccable.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;Once again, I thank you for browsing the RebelLUG blog. I hope it&rsquo;s helped you out thus far.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Till the next post,</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Spencer</span></span><br /><br />&#8203;</div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Having and constantly accumulating more LEGO obviously leads to a few questions along the lines of &ldquo;where do you even buy it?&rdquo; This post may be directly a little more toward the crowd of folks new to the community rather than the really experienced builders who are familiar with all the ropes of the LEGO buying world. But since I meet people all too often that haven&rsquo;t used BrickLink when they desperately need specific parts, I want to share all the knowledge I&rsquo;ve got on the matter in a two part blog. First, everywhere I commonly at least browse for deals on the Internet and potentially order them. And second, physical retail stores or meet-ups out in the real world for buying brick.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;The go-to place whenever looking to buy LEGO parts is easily Bricklink. In the past, new buyers, including myself, were a little sketched out about how the whole process went and how the website looked (until the recent overhaul) and operated, but over my dozens of orders I&rsquo;ve never had a big problem. It works similar to eBay in a sense, where it&rsquo;s essentially a big marketplace. It&rsquo;s composed of independent stores who all choose to open up shop on the same site. When you order from more than one store, they&rsquo;ll come in different packages, of course. There&rsquo;s a feedback system so you can tell if someone is untrustworthy, which seems to be super rare on Bricklink.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">To get a start over there, make your way to a store either by looking at the part you want and seeing who has it, or by just looking at the largest stores and go look for that part in those. Once there, feel free to dander through all the categories and colors for anything cool at a good price and add it to your cart. The rest should be self explanatory enough till you get the hang of it.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Although most likely more commonly known than Bricklink for parts, I would not advise ordering off of LEGO&rsquo;s own Shop at Home Pick a Brick. Only in very limited situations are the prices cheaper, let alone reasonable compared to going rates around the rest of the community. Unless you need unheard of quantity and you&rsquo;re willing to pay the premium for new parts plus shipping from Denmark, LEGO.com won&rsquo;t be the best option as much as they advertise it on all the catalogs and such.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;My last source for parts, that rarely comes up with anything of shocking value at a great price: eBay. I believe eBay has sort of been tainted by masses who now look for stuff on it all day long across the world, and sellers know they can be a little more outrageous than fair. Either that or they&rsquo;re trying to compensate for eBay&rsquo;s ridiculous fees. From every look I&rsquo;ve taken over the years, it never seems like a great place for buyers; however, I do think it&rsquo;s great for sellers.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">There&rsquo;s a good handful of retail online stores such as Walmart or Target, and since it&rsquo;s pretty much hand and hand with them now, Amazon. All the time I see great deals on sets getting bought up just in the nick of time before the rest of the world snatches as much as they can, most likely for resell. So how do you arrive before crowds of vultures swoop in to make a profit? That is going to be a big topic for part two, because it&rsquo;s essentially the same method used for stores out in the real world.</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, glad you took a read through the blog. If you found it somewhat useful or have anything to add, leave a comment down below. Thanks for reading</span></span><br /><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Till the next post,</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Spencer</span></span><br /><br /></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Back in the days of old, &nbsp;contests used to be a real popular site amongst LEGO YouTube and Flickr, but since they seemed to have fell off. They used to be a lot of fun, so RebelLUG wants to bring back some of that excitement and competitiveness into the community. We're hosting our very first contest! The challenge is to build your favorite scene from the new Star Wars movie, Rogue One, out of LEGO. You'll be entered for a chance to win unannounced (from LEGO) 2017 Rogue One sets and weapons courtesy of <a href="http://www.clonearmycustoms.com/" target="_blank">Clone Army Customs</a>! Make sure to get a start as soon as possible because the deadline is February first, only a little while away. More details can be found in the video below.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe contests are about challenging yourself as a builder and using said contest as a prompt to guide you to do so. Not only do they benefit you as an individual, especially if you win, but the whole community challenging itself and inevitably innovating from it. From that is where I'll at least be looking for a winner in the judging: innovation, creativity, and style. A few key techniques that stuck around for a long time stick out in my mind from the past that were essentially the result of builders trying to win contests.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're looking to take the prize as the winner of RebelLUG's contest, and future contests for that matter, that is what I recommend aiming for. MOCs coming out of the entire community can get stagnant from time to time till a new wave, and I want to see the next person do something really cool that I've never seen before, and I'm positive that goes for all judges.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Using pieces that everyone's got lying around without a use for, or parts that are easy to come by, say by the Pick A Brick wall, and using them in a way no one has thought of before is always a great step. How often do you see the transparent blue stud water technique now a days, or that weird period in 2010 when the only things comprising bases were 2x4's, red tiles, and grass stalks? Without the curved 1x2 brick technique bringing brought over from wherever else on the Internet, so many memorable MOCs would be lost.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, I hope that little speech gives you some direction to head in with your entry.<br /><br />Till the next post,<br />Spencer<br /></div>  <div class="wsite-youtube" style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;"><div class="wsite-youtube-wrapper wsite-youtube-size-auto wsite-youtube-align-center"> <div class="wsite-youtube-container">  <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jFyAmN6Vslc?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Throughout winter break I&rsquo;ve been sorting some collections I sort of absorbed and MOCs I finished. I wanted to make something out of all this lego sorting and that gave me enough inspiration to do this.</span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">But that&rsquo;s not the point. I have a few words that I want to share on mass sorting brick. Without getting a Javier or involving local children, how do you remain sane while sorting thousands of tiny plastic parts into a few hundred drawers and totes. And are there any ways to cheat the system and do it faster? We&rsquo;ll get to that later. </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Me, personally, I listen to music audiobooks or movies, sometimes eavesdrop on IDS wannabes. Basically anything that doesn&rsquo;t require my full attention and keeps me entertained. </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">But how do I pick up efficiency? I think that&rsquo;s what everyone's actually here for. Taking breaks and getting out of the groove slows you down a lot. A goal I had with this huge batch of sorting was to try and improve my attention span because normally I would stop every hour and go play rocket league until I lost and the only way to cope with my self loath was torture in the form of lego sorting, yet again</span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Another big one is to physically surround yourself with all the drawers you need or find yourself going to all the time. One time I surrounded myself with actual drawer units as if it was a fort for some sort of satanic ritual. But it worked, and I could get a ton done in one day. Just had to deal with the pain of crossing your legs for 10 hours at a time since I was sitting on the floor.</span></span><br /><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">But the big thing here is to just temporarily get all the final destinations of parts as close as possible</span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Finally, I suggest going batch by batch. The logic here is to be sorting similar pieces all at one time. That will limit traveling time and how much you&rsquo;re picking a particular thing out. Big time saver. After my boy KrisProductions made his collection video that you never got to see, he destroyed all his sets in spectacular fashion down the stairs. Although he filmed it, apparently that never got anywhere either. But that&rsquo;s besides the point. He warned me about destroying sets and combining all of them in a big sorting pile because he ended up with way more variety than he needed. If he went set by set, batch by batch, this would have been a lot easier. This should also be applied to MOCs. Just do one MOC at a time.</span></span><br /><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">This idea obviously doesn't work if it&rsquo;s all in a giant concoction of bricks, but you still get those little achievements along the way.</span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">On a second note, putting it in a low, yet large ish tub will allow you to see most of what you&rsquo;re going through at one time. This makes it easy to pick out all of one piece so you can slowly take out different categories. From my experience this is the fastest way, but I do also occasionally just take a big handful and walk around and sort out each part into its respective drawer.</span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">But yeah, I&rsquo;ll take Kris&rsquo; advice and use it over the next few weeks as I sort and sort the collections I&rsquo;ve absorbed and the MOCs I forgot to part out. But once I&rsquo;m done I have some real cool plans. That&rsquo;s usually what drives me, the next project. Stay tuned to all the RebelLUG channels for not only my content, but the rest of the groups&rsquo;, because we all go through these same engless struggles. Anyway, thank you for reading. Your feedback is just as appreciated if you like the blog or not, as long as it&rsquo;s honest.</span></span><br /><span></span><br />&#8203;<br /></div>
