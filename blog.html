The majority voted for the Jedi Temple...</p>

It was 7:10 a.m. by the time Tristan (TrisBrick) and myself were waiting for our bus at the main bus terminal. The destination was Kockice Con 2018, located in Zagreb, Croatia. A few months earlier, I was contacted by one of my superiors within the LUG, Luke (FirstOrderLego), who pitched me the idea of the three of us going to the event to display a large array of MOCs. Tristan and I, of course, agreed to come.</p>

I actually tried, but subsequently failed. This was due to a number of factors, one of them being I had no understanding of how lighting and cameras work. Another being the fact that I was twelve and simply wasn't mentally equipped to plan the creation of a stop motion video that met the standard.</p>

                                            <p>About a year and a half ago I emerged from my Lego “dark age”. In the time since then, my largest struggle as a MOC builder has been parts usage.</p>

Because of this my builds (with the exception of a PAB cup and a few Rogue One sets) have been up to this point sourced from my preexisting collection.  I needed to learn how to maximize the pieces and bricks I already had. The limitations of my collection have made me a passionate advocate for the term I have coined “Brick Conservation”..</p>

                                            <p>We’ve all probably used it once or, in some cases, way more than once: Bricklink. A very useful website if you need a lot of a certain type of part or a whole list of parts for a project.</p>

The only sets I have bought in the past 2 or 3 years have been battlepacks, which even with raised prices compared to when they first came out actually have quite a good value if you need all the included minifigures. But if you, like myself, do not collect sets and are really just interested in parts to build MOC’s, is buying sets even worth it? I compared one of my Bricklink orders (see images) to gain some insight in the difference in price per brick. The per brick price in the order is about 0.085 eurocents per brick, and it contains a licensed Star Wars minifig, as well as a mix of cheap and expensive lots.</p>

Since the first one I posted on YouTube in 2010 I've improved considerably, as I would assume everyone else would as they gain more experience. Now, hundreds of builds big and small, a good amount even posted on my Flickr and YouTube, I can look back and see my progression through the years. Especially with all of it posted on the Internet, in order from when I created it, it's easy to see maybe what some of my more pivotal creations were, or where I could have lost a little interest in the building scene. I encourage you to do the same because I've found it really interesting to delve into the archives of old LEGO models. Not only that, it seems to have simply served as a good source of inspiration for a few big undertakings I'm preparing to start in anticipation for BrickWorld Chicago to try and make them as awesome as possible. </p>

                                        <p>Around three years ago I joined LUGOLA, the LEGO User Group of Los Angeles. Since then I’ve been to a lot fun events and meetings, while also meeting some other builders. I even recently made a video partly about a LUG meeting I went to: link here. After my great experience I always encourage other fans to try and join LUG. This opens up a lot of avenues for collaboration in group activities you wouldn’t regularly be able to do if you weren’t at a much bigger convention or already knew some other FOLs. The extensive possibilities could range from huge collaborative MOCs to simply parts drafts. In this video from Brickworld RebelLUG did it’s own parts draft, and here is a picture of our actual collaboration. Now we really counting down till next year.</p>

A lot of us went last year, hung out with a met a bunch of new and legendary builders in the community. This year even more LEGO YouTubers and RebelLUG members will be attending. I’ve personally gone to many conventions through the years. Since 2011 I’ve been to Brickcon, Bricks by the Bay, BricksLA, and Brickworld. Here are some my bricks to prove it.</p>

I come up with a few ideas in a notebook just to make sure I remember them and basically just build and design the MOC as I go. But my last few MOCs haven’t exactly been the same in the sense that I could just look at an image for inspiration, or not even, and just go ahead. Instead, they were replicas of things obviously pre-designed, with existing models and proportions. This means it’s really important to get all the measurements in the correct scale.</p>

Although my knowledge isn’t on par with masters of clickbait and Internet manipulists, I’m going to throw in my two cents.</p>
