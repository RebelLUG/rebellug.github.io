The_Buff.jpg,Lego Buff Productions,"Board Member, LAN Ambassador","Hey, I'm Danny! I am most commonly found working behind the scenes on planning public LUG displays, setting up sponsorships, and running day-to-day LUG operations. As a Freshman at the University of Illinois studying Industrial Engineering, my time available for building has been severely limited. I have taken a recent interest to building movie-related creations.

spencer2.jpg,LegoSpencer,"Board Member, Design Lead, Web Admin","Hello, I'm Spencer. I find I like to build almost exclusively science fiction stuff. LEGO YouTube is where it all started almost ten years ago. Since then I've continued slowly making LEGO videos, but also other sorts of videos and short films. I'm now in college for film and television production at Loyola Marymount University. You can catch me at Brickworld Chicago, Brickfair Virginia, and some conventiions and shows around Southern California.",https://www.youtube.com/legospencer11,https://www.flickr.com/photos/legospencer11/,https://instagram.com/legospencer11,https://www.facebook.com/pg/legospencer,,,,1
