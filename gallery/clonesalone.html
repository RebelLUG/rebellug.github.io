                                <img src="images/clonesalonelogogray.png" alt="Gray Clones Alone Logo" class="collablogos"/>
                                <p>Clones Alone was the first RebelLUG collaboration. The idea for such a project originated sometime around late summer or early fall of 2015, and it essentially made way for the inception of RebelLUG itself. The original members of RebelLUG were the original participants of the collaboration. Those members were LegoSpencer, Lego Buff Productions, Kris Productions, Daniel Barwegen (then 501stLegoTrooper), alcloneproductions, LegoLord82, and Brickmaster Productions. To complete the story that was created, Spencer, Danny, Daniel, and Kris had to do two parts each to finish the 11 part story. It was an original story written by Spencer and Kris and it was initially released in December of 2015, with each episode coming out every week following that. It told the story of a group forsaken clones who had to make their way back to Republic territory.</p>
