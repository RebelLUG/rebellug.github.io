                                        <h2>Polishing Off and Professionalizing YouTube Videos with Free Resources</h2>
                                            <p>How anyone can utilize free online resources to boost their YouTube channels?</p>
                                            <h1>06/27/19</h1>
                                        </header>
                                        <p>This blog post involves how to significantly improve the quality and view count of your YouTube videos, by making them more visually appealing to viewers.</p>
                                        <span class="image center"><img src="images/professionalizing_your_youtube/thumbnail.PNG"/></span>
                                        <p>One aspect of digital media production that few pay attention to, let alone master, is the visual aesthetic design of their content. Particularly on YouTube, many LEGO builders, regardless of experience, fall short on many beneficial aspects that could skyrocket their view count and income. The thumbnail always seems to be an afterthought, with a close up or blurry picture taken, rarely with any text or engaging design to truly draw viewers in. Many successful YouTubers in general find a use in the motif of faces and expressions, usually placing a surprised expression to interest viewers and boost the clickthrough rate. While it may not be wise for a LEGO builder to have a surprised face featured in front of their MOC, the same principles of aesthetic and composition still apply. For this specific blog post, I will be focusing on the design of YouTube thumbnails, and how any builder can have a perfect, engaging thumbnail using completely free tools in no time.</p>                                        
                                        <p>Previously, I had paid no attention to thumbnails on YouTube, simply selecting a screenshot from the video to serve as a preface, and my views reflected that. I still have videos to this day that I am experimenting with where the old thumbnails mean several videos are still under 200 views on my channel. Here are three different thumbnail styles from videos uploaded almost at the same time:</p>
                                        <span class="image center"><img src="images/professionalizing_your_youtube/pickaxe.PNG"/></span>                                        
                                        <p>As you can see, the screenshot from the video of the Diamond Pickaxe performs the lowest, with the Nerf gun at a staggering 141,000 more views! The reason for this boils down to thumbnail design, a key way to drag in the viewer with a visual lasso.</p>
                                        <p>So now with these staggering, impressive results, the question becomes: how do you create these thumbnails? Keep in mind that for all of these thumbnails, all the resources I use are all entirely free and simple to use. The first tool begins with the Photoshop Mix app, which is available for free on all iOS devices. Using your phone, you can remove the background of a picture using the “Cut Out” tool. Originally I never took photos of my builds so I had to screenshot a point mid-video to crop out, so anyone can do this! Once you have the PNG file, there are multiple ways to transfer it to your computer (I use email as it is a convenient send with full quality but you can use Google Photos or others). I then import the file onto my primary editing website, Canva. In Canva, you can make a custom image with your own dimensions (the YouTube thumbnail size is 1280x720 px). The most important part is to have consistent thumbnails so returning viewers can recognize you. For example, I use a purple box around the outside to make it stand out from other YouTubers, with my logo and other splashes of purple. The accessories like mist and small dust may seem trivial, but it can change a thumbnail from basic and bland to something that catches the viewer’s eye. Using layers and the PNG file you can arrange a MOC on the thumbnail with accessories and text (I use cooltext.com as a font generator for each game). Once the thumbnail is finished, rework it a few times until the composition is full and lively, as the point of a thumbnail is similar to a worm in fishing, to lure in visitors. You will know when it feels right, and it may take a couple times to revisit.</p>
                                        <p>Here’s proof of the results with my analytics after I revised my thumbnails:</p>
                                        <span class="image center"><img src="images/professionalizing_your_youtube/stats.PNG" style="height: 400px; width: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></span>                                        
                                        <p>Bear in mind it does not guarantee permanent high views, you still need to have consistent uploads and interaction to supplement this, but these small tricks could make your YouTube channel go viral, so try them out!</p>
