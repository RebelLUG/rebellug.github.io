                                        <h2>Interview with PeachBricks</h2>
                                            <p>The fifth episode in the RebelLUG interview series</p>
                                            <h1>11/10/18</h1>
                                        </header>
                                        <h1>1. First of all, who are you and what social media platforms are you found on?</h1> 
                                            
                                        <p> Currently I can be found on Instagram (peachbricks), Reddit (peachbricks), Flickr (Elijah Chamberlain), and YouTube (PeachBricks)</p>
                                       <h1>2. Which social media platform is your favorite, or which one do you prefer to visit, and what content do you like to browse and/or produce on each?</h1>
                                            
                                      
                                       <p>Personally, when looking at LEGO builds which is pretty much all I’m interested I look through Flickr very often, however I usually use Instagram to see new set leaks, news, and to communicate through DM's.</p>                                     <h1>3. How long have you been building with LEGO, and how long have you been involved in the LEGO community? Where and when did you start posting online?</h1>
                                        
                                       <p>I’ve been playing with LEGO for as long as I can remember, my earliest MOC photos are from somewhere around 2010, I began watching YouTube videos in 2013, and made my first video in late 2014. Ever since then I’ve expanded into all the other platforms I listed.</p>
                                        
                                       
                                        <h1>4. Where do you draw inspiration? Are there any certain builders or MOCs that inspire you? Or do you get inspired outside of LEGO?</h1>                                           
                                            
                                        <p>For builders, I’d say Simon NH on Flickr, Nick Trotta on Flickr, and Blake Foster on Flickr, are some of my favorites that I can think of off the top of my head, they all have absolutely phenomenal builds, and are really inspiring builders. When it comes to real life inspiration, I always like looking at really old churches and thinking of how to build them in LEGO -however I have yet to build one. </p>
                                        <h1>5. What's your favorite theme or subject to build in? Why do you find it so appealing?</h1>
                                            
                                        <p>I’ve never really found a concrete MOC style I like, however I find Sci-FI vehicles really fun and challenging. I also really enjoy building medieval MOCs as well.</p>
                                        <h1>6. What is your favorite hobby or social activity outside of building? How do you spend your time outside of the LEGO realm?</h1>
                                            
                                        <p>I do a fair amount of soccer, which is something I enjoy a lot. Otherwise I mostly just do LEGO (and videogames :p)

                                        </p>
                                        <h1>7. What are your favorites (music, movies, books, etc.)?</h1>                                            
                                            
                                        <p>I listen to A LOT of music when I’m building and such, I really like some of Childish Gambino’s stuff, along with Logic, and Post Malone, so mostly all modern hip-hop/pop music. I’m also really big into TV shows, currently some of my favorites would be Black Sails, Vikings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Game of Thrones, The 100, Clone Wars, Superstore, and The Office (to name a few).</p>
                                        <h1>8. What's an aspect of the LEGO community that you would want to change?</h1>
                                            
                                        <p>I want sand green to be rare again. But in all seriousness, I think people should focus on taking quality MOC photos. Working hard on something and giving it a garbage photo is a horrible way to represent your work!
</p>
                                       <h1>9. What is your favorite MOC that you’ve built? Or the one you’re most proud of?</h1>                                            
                                            
                                        <p>So I’ve always built relatively smaller MOCs (bad habit) but one of those that I think I did a really good job on would be my E-74 Landspeeder (https://www.flickr.com/photos/peachisdank/43088917372/in/dateposted-public/)

                                        <h1>10. Do all your friends/family know you build with LEGO as a hobby? Or is it something that has never come up in a conversation?</h1>

                                        <p>Ya I’m actually pretty public about it, I post photos from conventions and such on my personal Instagram and I’m completely fine with talking about it. It’s just the artistic medium I like to use, and it’s honestly just fun.</p>
