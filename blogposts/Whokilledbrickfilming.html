                                        <h2>Who killed the Brickfilming Community</h2>
                                            <p>The brickfilming scene in the Lego community has long been considered "dead," but how did it
                                            end up that way?
</p>
                                            <h1>10/20/18</h1>
                                        </header>
                                        <p>Everyone who was around at the time remembers the golden years of brickfilming.
The years
between 2008 and 2012 were an unprecedented age of growth and creativity for the Lego stopmotion
animation community. It gave rise to YouTube channels with unforgettable names like
“pizzamovies”, “spugesdu”, “darthmilo77”, “fancypants”, “Keshen8”, and “ZachMG”. But the
prosperity wouldn’t last. The health of the community gradually began to fade as quickly as it
                                            had risen.</p>
                                            
<p>Today, the brickfilming
community looks very different. It’s a smaller, niche group that’s often
overlooked and forgotten by the broader Lego community. People still occasionally create
brickfilms
with their Lego, but they don’t get nearly the same attention they used to. And to this
day, brickfilmers
continue to ask the question, “Who killed the brickfilming
    community?”</p>
                                            
<p>The answer isn’t simple by any means. Brickfilmers
have theorized a plethora of reasons for
the death of their beloved community, including everything from changes to the YouTube
algorithm to the sudden cancellation of the popular Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series which
captivated much of the Lego community during the golden age. There’s credibility to all of
these reasons, yet none explain how such a diverse community seemingly vanished overnight.
If I were to give an answer, I would say that after interviewing individuals from both the building
and animating communities, and extensive reection
on what visibly happened, I have
concluded that the death of the bricklming
community was not a murder, but a suicide. To
suggest that it was brickfilmers
that killed their own community is nothing short of
controversial, and will certainly anger a few people, but please hear me out and allow me to
    explain.</p>
                                            
<p>Many people correctly point out that just before things got bad, a number of prominent
bricklmers
left the community to pursue important things in their personal lives such as
college. One can hardly blame them, as keeping up a hobby like bricklming
is dicult
while
living away from your Lego and lming
equipment. However, communities rarely die because a
few important people disappear. When this happens, it falls on those left in the group to carry
on and assume their roles. Unfortunately, in the case of the bricklming
community, those
whom the mantel fell to made a crucial mistake by alienating a key demographic: Lego fans.
Yes, that’s right, Lego fans.
                                        </p>              
                                        
<p>You see, brickfilming
is a hobby that combines both the Lego and stop-motion animation
hobbies, and thus draws from both communities. During the golden age of brickfilming,
the
vast majority of people who spent their time creating and watching bricklms
were Lego fans
that simply wanted a means to bring their creations to life, rather than hobbyist filmmakers who had chosen to use Lego as a medium for stop-motion. This is evidenced by the fact that
many popular brickfilm
channels, including my own, featured other kinds of Lego related
content including MOCs, army showcases, reviews, tutorials, and custom minigures.
Back
then it was common for friendships to transcend all branches of the Lego community, with
groups featuring MOC builders, customizers, and brickfilmers
    alike.</p>
                                            
<p>This unity ultimately suffered as things in the brickfilming
community began to fall apart. The
animators who remained and those who succeeded the ones who had left seemed
increasingly focused on the fillmmaking
aspect of the hobby, and the attention was turned
away from the Lego community on which the bricklming
hobby depended. One could argue
that they had always held this focus, as many of them made no secret about their desire to
work in the film
industry someday. But without the major community members whose love of
the brick came first,
the consequence was still the same. As the focus of the bricklming
community shifted away from the medium and more towards nuanced lmmaking,
much of
the Lego community lost interest in brickfilms,
and likewise many brickfilmers
lost interest in
reaching out to others in the broader Lego community. This was ultimately the brickfilming
    community’s death knell, and it would never be the same.</p>
                                        
<p>Since then, the brickfilming
hobby has endured, but in a greatly diminished state. Great
brickfilms
continue to awe and inspire us, but much of the community still spends its time
speaking more of movies and prominent directors than of their hobby. In spite of this, it
continues to seek a means to recapture the glories of the past to no avail because something
is always missing. We can rebuild, but efforts to do so will not succeed unless brickfilmers
    seek to reengage with the broader Lego community.</p>
                                        
<p>This is something I’ve worked at tirelessly over the past several months. By joining RebelLUG
and displaying my films
at Lego conventions, I’ve sought to remind the Lego community that
brickfilmers
still exist, and that it doesn’t take being a filmmaker
or an artist to do what we do.
The results have been nothing short of remarkable. I’ve seen several well-known builders
picking up their cameras and giving it a shot after getting to know me, and in turn, I’ve also
been reminded by them of what a joy it can be to simply sit down with your collection and just
    build something to enjoy as it is.</p>
                                        
<p>The brickfilming
community has a future, and it can be a bright one if we fully embrace the
medium that made it so great in the rst
place. I encourage every brickfilmer
out there to get
more involved in the Lego community. Join a LUG! Go to a convention! Try something new with
your channel! But most importantly, make friends with the other people in this incredible
community! I promise you won’t regret it, because together we can create some truly amazing
things!</p>
