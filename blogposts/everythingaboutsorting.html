                                        <h2>Everything About Sorting on the Table</h2>
                                            <p>My suggestions for when it comes to how your should sort your LEGO.</p>
                                            <h1>3/12/17</h1>
                                        </header>
                                        <p>For almost all “enthusiast” LEGO builders, sorting all those little bricks can be the bane of your existence. So today I am here to tell you all my suggestions for when it comes to how your should sort your LEGO.</p>
                                        <p>I’ve got a lot of organizing to do right now from my last few MOCs, so I thought it would be appropriate to kickoff my Collection Series with a video about sorting. I think everyone who enjoys building should have their pieces organized so, today we’re going to go over all the different reasons why you would want to sort in different ways, and why I sort the way I do. Without any further ado, let’s begin.</p>
                                        <p>In my eyes, there are 2 different extremes when it comes to sorting: by color or by piece. And everything in between. Everyone basically falls in that in between. How you do it is determined by the following factors: how/what you build, the state of your collection, how often you use different pieces, and how much effort you’re willing to put in. You want to put in some time and use these to decide how you should categorize all your parts. After that, of course you’ll need somewhere to store them, which I will have a video on a little later.</p>
                                        <p>What do these different things really mean, and how should they affect how you sort? First of all, how/what you build. We all build differently, how we come up with designs and such. And I’m sure there's a wide variety of people who build different themes in the audience right now. So that means there’s no one way to sort. You should atune it to your needs.</p>
                                        <p>My light gray is a good example. First of all, it’s sorted into a LOT of different categories, because I probably use it more than anything. The first few being different sized bricks and plates. I like to have the bricks and plates sorted out for almost all the colors because those are more usually structural parts, and I don't want to dig to find all of them. Then I have 2 bins for sort of all the random parts, minus all the specific things that are taken out.</p>
                                        <p>When I go to make something, I really have no idea what I’m going to do. So having all of these pieces right in front of me is super helpful when it comes to experimenting and finding a design. I usually know the size of what I’m making, so I have a bin for 4x4 and below random parts. And then everything bigger. Then a lot of the things I use frequently, I have completely sorted out. That can mean a specific part, or a type of part. For example, I use a lot of jumpers, technic bricks, and hinges, so I have all of those taken out of every color. When a kind of part is sorted, it usually overrides color.</p>
                                        <p>Now I know a lot of people that would prefer to sort by piece over color. I sort of do both, but they really just like to do it by piece. This is because of how they build. I’ve noticed that these people usually have an idea before going into making something. They also tend to design things, then buy parts in whatever color they need it in. I personally don’t like to do that, so I sort by color so that I can make it in the right color the first time.</p>
                                        <p>This brings me well into the state of your collection. If you don’t have a lot of pieces in whatever color, you might not want to sort by just that color. That might mean that you like to design then order the right color.</p>
                                        <p>How often you use pieces is pretty obvious. I kind of already went over this, and I’m sure you can figure it out, but I’ll give another example. I sort my grey plates out more than say my yellow ones, because of how often I use them. This can also be applied to how much you have of them, or the state of your collection.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, how much effort you’re willing to put in. I’ll get into this a lot more next episode when I talk about all the reasons why you would want to sort out your LEGO piece collection if you’re a builder, but it essentially means taking all the time to just do it right. None of this means anything if you just sort it by color and call it a day, when it really isn’t optimal for you as a builder.</p>
                                        <p>Anyway, for those who made it through the whole article, I hope I was able to give you some tips if you were in need. Thanks for reading.</p>
