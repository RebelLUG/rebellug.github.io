                                        <h2>REVIEW 75219 IMPERIAL AT-HAULER</h2>
                                            <p>A review of the upcoming set from Solo: A Star Wars Story.
</p>
                                            <h1>8/5/18</h1>
                                        </header>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2001.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>This set has 829 pieces, is rated for ages 9 and up, and will be released on August 1st.  The box artwork is consistent with the first wave of Solo sets.  This review contains very minor spoilers beyond what is on the box art itself.</p>
                                        <p>UNBOXING:</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2002.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>The flaps on the boxes have been redesigned.  At first glance, I thought the box had been opened and the folding tab reinserted.  However, the seals were still intact.</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2003.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>This ended up being a new security tab.  Even after cutting through the tape, you are unable to open the box without ripping the tab off, which then slides inside the box. This inexpensive and mildly effective added layer of security, while interesting, is sad to see the necessity of.  I expect this will be the new norm for larger size sets.</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2004.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>The set has 7 numbered bags and an additional one with the instructions and sticker sheet inside.</p>
                                        <p>THE BUILD:</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2005.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>The first bag builds the lower walkway and a storage container with a weapons rack that slides inside. This Technic heavy part of the build comes with a large quantity of Technic lift arms and other pieces in reddish brown.</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2006.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>Qi'ra is the first figure, and one that does not belong in this scene. She is a nice figure with an interesting fur wrapping over her outfit.  She has a dual-sided face, neither expression being an over-the-top exaggeration.  Her hair is a Friends piece and is made of the softer rubberized plastic.</p>
                                        <p>BAG 2 AND 3:</p>
                                        <p><span class="image left center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2007.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>These bags build the identical, but mirrored arms on each side of the vehicle. The packaging for the bags is interesting because bag 2 has two internal bags and contains three extra pieces while bag 3 has one internal bag and no extra pieces.  My copy of this set was short two blue Technic half pins. Hardly an issue, as they are so common, but interesting as I have seen an increase in mistakes in the packaging process of Lego sets recently. The build for bag 2 and 3 is mildly complex Technic; nothing super exciting or original and kind of repetitive considering you are building copies of the same thing.</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2008.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>Dryden's guards are identical to each other, with the exception of the face printing.  One has a frown and the other, a grimace. These two Hylobons are unexpected in this set as they have nothing to do with this sequence.  I am glad to have these figures and like them quite well though they are a particularly odd choice to include in the set.  It is possible that some of the figures included are based off of the original cut of the film before Ron Howard took over as director and re-filmed a vast majority of it.</p>
                                        <p>BAG 4 AND 5:</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2009.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>These bags, like 2 and 3, complete both sides of the AT-Hauler's arms. They polish off the exterior plating, and bag 5 also builds the hooks on the front of the arms. These bags move out of the Technic end of the build and into standard system pieces.  I have a bizarre fascination with the 2x3 tile introduced in 2016, and these bags have a total of 8 of them in white.</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2010.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>Val has great printing that moves from the torso to the legs. She has a lot of harnesses and clips which could be used for some fun custom figures.  The print would work in many non-Star Wars settings as well. Her face has an alt expression with her wearing goggles.</p>
                                        <p>BAG 6:</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2011.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>This bag builds the main body of the vehicle and the foundation for the cockpit.  The bulk of this build is setting up for the panels in the final bag and support bricks to keep the body solid.</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2012.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>Rio Durant is a very interesting figure, and overall, I feel that Lego did a fairly good job. He is short in stature and has four arms.  Unable to use the added torso piece, as they did for Garmadonâ€™s extra arms, Lego molded a new piece that is essentially two arms fused together.  They fit into the single standard arm socket. This means both arms on each side are completely linked and cannot be moved separately. However, it seems like the most logical solution, and I feel like it works fairly well and keeps him short.  I wish his head was less brightly colored. Sand blue would have been a nicer, more muted shade than medium blue.  He has connection tabs on the side of his head for the visor piece. While this works well with the visor on, it makes the head look a little odd when the visor is removed.</p>
                                        <p>BAG 7:</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2013.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>This bag includes some final detail work and finishes the front cockpit area.  It also contains the only two non-Minifig printed pieces.  These are the 4x4 white radar dishes on the side of the cockpit. I did not apply any of the stickers during my build as I felt most of them did not add much to the final product, with the notable exception of the front windscreen. </p>
                                        <p>THE FINAL PRODUCT:</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2014.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>Qi'ra is the first figure, and one that does not belong in this scene. She is a nice figure with an interesting fur wrapping over her outfit.  She has a dual-sided face, neither expression being an over-the-top exaggeration.  Her hair is a Friends piece and is made of the softer rubberized plastic.</p>
                                        <p><span class="image center"><img src="images/75219-imperial-at-hauler-review/Photo%2015.jpg" alt="blog picture description"/></span>The piece count (829) is rather low for a $100 set.  You are looking at $0. 12 apiece on this set, which is not bad, but definitely not great, particularly for the vehicle you get.  This set is designed to go with the Imperial Conveyex Transport (75217) and the Cloud-Rider Swoop Bikes (75215).  Lego did a similar thing with the first wave of Solo sets, making three that revolved around the chase on Corellia.  The Imperial AT-Hauler has a good selection and variety of pieces along with some great figures.  This set is too small for accuracy and the retail price.  It does not feel like $100 set once finished; more like a $60-$75 set.</p>
                                        <p>Overall, I feel that this is a decent, but overpriced set. Unless you have a passion for the figures, the vehicle itself, or want to recreate the entire sequence with the train and the AT-Hauler, I suggest waiting on this set until you can pick it up at a discount.  This set was made available August 1st.</p>
