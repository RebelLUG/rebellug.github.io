                                        <h2>Interview with First Order Lego</h2>
                                            <p></p>
                                            <h1>10/09/18</h1>
                                        </header>
                                        <p><i>1. First of all, who are you and what social media platforms are you found on?</i> 

                                        My name is Luka (Luke), I’m 19 years old. I was born in Australia (Melbourne), but I currently live in a beautiful, ancient, Mediterranean costal city called Split (in Croatia-Europe). I’m a LEGO builder and go by the name ‘First Order Lego’ online (YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Flickr).</p>
                                        <p><i>2. Which social media platform is your favorite, or which one do you prefer to visit, and what content do you like to browse and/or produce on each?</i>

                                        My favourite media to use is YouTube, due to it having such a large and active LEGO community. Plus, it’s pretty easy and fun to create videos/slideshows in which you can showcase all angles of the MOC, while it’s hard to post 80+ photos of a MOC on Instagram for example. I use Twitter for random tweets about what I’m doing, Flickr for professional photos of my MOCs and Instagram to show behind the scenes, hauls, teasers, announcements etc. I’m also an official Brickly artist. I also recently created a Reddit account and I must say the amount of people that are active on Reddit is amazing, it’s probably the best way to get some good feedback and I would definitely suggest anyone to start up an account. As far as what I browse on these platforms it’s mostly LEGO MOCs of all sorts. I use many social medias but YouTube will always remain my main platform.</p>                                     <p><i>3. How long have you been building with LEGO, and how long have you been involved in the LEGO community? Where and when did you start posting online?</i> 

                                        I’ve been building from around the age of 10, but only recently, well actually 3 years ago I got involved in the LEGO community on YouTube. Prior to that, I was a very active member of the LEGO.com Gallery (back when it was actually cool and something similar to MOC pages). I posted my first MOCs there, took part in Role-Play and met so many great people. I love reminiscing about all the amazing friends and moments I experienced there. However, the Gallery wasn’t that big and hence, there were not that many skilful builders to compete with and learn from. So when the new Gallery update arrived in 2016, I decided to switch to YouTube where I am today. I was called Deathwatch000 on the Gallery, it’s the place where I posted my first MOCs. So just for you reading this interview I went all the way back and dug up some pics of my first MOCs never seen before by my current audience and followers.         ( P.s.- sorry for the bad quality):
                                        PIC.1.- My first ever MOC- Gregor’s last stand from the Clone Wars
                                        PIC.2.-Classic clone base
                                        PIC.3. and 4.- Geonosis arena and random Geonosis build
                                        PIC.5.- Venator Clone Wars ship
                                        PIC.6.- Random island MOC 
                                        PIC. 7. and 8.-  2 versions of my clone gunship
                                        PIC. 9. and 10.- My first big, popular, decent MOC-Kashyyyk, cuz why not</p>

                                        <i>4. Where do you draw inspiration? Are there any certain builders or MOCs that inspire you? Or do you get inspired outside of LEGO?</i> 
                                            
                                        While most people will say their main inspirations came from Solid Brix Studios, Krisproductions, Legobuffproductions, LegoSpencer... my inspiration, besides these legendary YouTubers, comes from my followers. One of the reasons I love building and posting my builds on social media is the feedback I get in return. It inspires me to keep creating. I “feed” on the feedback. </p>
                                        <p><i>5. What's your favorite theme or subject to build in? Why do you find it so appealing?</i>

                                        My favourite theme to build in is quite obvious, just by reading my username. Why Star Wars, you might be asking? Well, I frankly don’t really know, it’s one of those things that you just “fall in love” with and grow up with. The locations, vehicles and scenes are always so fascinating and due to it being so popular there are always people interested in the theme. I love building scenes from all eras, all the way back to The Old Republic, Prequels, O.T, Battlefront... 
                                        Besides SW, I am a massive fan of the Witcher 3 video game, Lord of The Rings movies and that sort of medieval setting. I hope I can build more MOCs set in these themes in the future.</p>
                                        <p><i>6. What is your favorite hobby or social activity outside of building? How do you spend your time outside of the LEGO realm?</i> 

                                        Outside of the LEGO realm, I like to play video games on the PS4 with my brother and friends. I try to exercise regularly at the gym and I play football with my friends at least once a week. I don’t watch TV that much but I often go to the cinemas due to tickets here being quite cheap. I love partying and going out to clubs. I also recently got a job at my local LEGO store so that takes a lot of my time. Travelling is also something I spend my money on (besides LEGO ;)</p>
                                        <p><i>7. What are your favorites (music, movies, books, etc.)?</i>
                                            
                                        Movie saga: definitely Star Wars (favourite episode- Revenge of the Sith), with Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and Harry Potter coming close behind.
                                        TV series-Clone Wars
                                        Book: Republic and Imperial commando novels by Karen Traviss
                                        Video game: Witcher 3, KOTOR 1 and 2, all the Battlefronts
                                        Sport and club: Football and Real Madrid
                                        Music: I mostly listen to techno and pop for example: Of monsters and Men, Marshmello, David Guetta, Post Malone, The Weeknd, Chainsmokers, Coldplay, Sia, Dua Lipa etc. Although my favourite thing to do is just pop a game or movie soundtrack on or some random epic/relaxing/chill music and enjoy. This is also what I do while building.</p>
                                        <p><i>8. What's an aspect of the LEGO community that you would want to change?</i>

                                        Honestly, nothing really, there is a good amount of builders, reviewers and all other types of LEGO centric channels. Of course there is drama, memes and comedy, but there always needs to be a little bit of that. It’s always great to have better/more competition, more MOC contests so I hope the community grows more and more, especially with new, original builders.</p>
                                        <p><i>9. What is your favorite MOC that you’ve built? Or the one you’re most proud of?</i>
                                            
                                        This is a really hard question because I don’t have one specific MOC I like the most.
                                        If I had to choose my 3 favourite builds they would probably be: Crait, Lotho Minor and Theed (in no particular order).
                                        just like them because they turned out better than I imagined they would and they were well received by my followers. Whenever I start building a MOC I never really have a clear vision of the build, I never use LDD. Sometimes I might quickly sketch it up but I really just like going in “naked” and seeing where my mind and fingers will take me :D</p>

                                        <i>10. Do all your friends/family know you build with LEGO as a hobby? Or is it something that has never come up in a conversation?</i>

                                        I think that all of my family and friends know about my LEGO hobby and my YouTube channel. 
                                        There are occasions where I don’t want to bring up my LEGO hobby like the first 2 years of high school (grade 9 and 10) I never told anyone about it. But then in year 11  I held a brief  talk about it in from of the whole class and everyone found it really interesting. Of course people will sometimes tease you about it and tell you that you are childish, but I was never bullied or offended by anyone due to me having a LEGO hobby.  And if you ever are just remember the famous line by George Bernard Shaw: “We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.”
                                        You can’t get to really know me if you don’t know of my hobby. It simply is a part of me and I hope it forever will be.

                                        Thanks for having me! </p>
