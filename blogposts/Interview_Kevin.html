                                        <h2>Interview with Brick Ninja</h2>
                                            <p>The eigth episode in the RebelLUG Interview series</p>
                                            <h1>1/12/19</h1>
                                        </header>
                                        <h1>1. First of all, who are you and what social media platforms are you found on?</h1> 
                                            
                                        <p>Kevin may be the name on my birth certificate, but Brick Ninja is more memorable, so I use that online.  I mostly use Flickr (Brick Ninja) and Instagram (brick.ninja) I have a YouTube channel, that maybe I'll use at some point...
</p>
                                       <h1>2. Which social media platform is your favorite, or which one do you prefer to visit, and what content do you like to browse and/or produce on each?</h1>
                                            
                                      
                                       <p>I like Flickr the best, and I use that for finished builds mostly.  I like how Flickr has the feed, but also has folders so you can group things together.  Instagram is probably my more popular account and I use that most days, posting random updates, Work In Progress shots, and finished projects.
                                        </p>                                     
                                        <h1>3. How long have you been building with LEGO, and how long have you been involved in the LEGO community? Where and when did you start posting online?</h1>
                                        
                                       <p> I've been building with Lego since I was 4 or 5.  I first started interacting online in the Lego community on Lugnet in around 2002.  I also used Brick Shelf for hosting my builds in those early years. I remember back when BrickLink was called BrickBay.  I later moved to Facebook and MOCpages, before moving to Flickr and Instagram. </p>                                        

                                        <h1>4. Where do you draw inspiration? Are there any certain builders or MOCs that inspire you? Or do you get inspired outside of LEGO?</h1>                                           
                                            
                                        <p>I focus a lot of my builds on scenes or things from different forms of media.  The majority of my builds are pulled from movies, books, or videogames.  Most of my inspiration comes from books and movies, but I also get a lot from walking around at conventions.  I always prefer to see MoCs in person.
                                        </p>
                                        <h1>5. What's your favorite theme or subject to build in? Why do you find it so appealing?</h1>
                                            
                                        <p>My favorite themes to build in are castle/fantasy and Star Wars.  I love fantasy stories and I love bringing them into some form of reality.  Building in this theme has a little more flexibility or room for creative interpretation.  There's a certain level of expected wear and tear or organized haphazardness in the design of Castle/fantasy builds, that gives you a nice level of creativity and flexibility.  Star Wars in a lot of cases is kind of the opposite. It relies on creativity to replicate an exact precise thing. there's a lot of old and worn stuff in Star Wars as well, but you have a very fixed idea of what it should look like and it's coming down to trying to replicate that as closely as possible which is a very different challenge.  Both of them provide very fun and interesting builds with lots of complications, neither one is easier nor harder than the other but they have different challenges which is fun and refreshing to move back and forth between the two.
 </p> 
                                        <h1>6. What is your favorite hobby or social activity outside of building? How do you spend your time outside of the LEGO realm?</h1>
                                            
                                        <p>Those who know me know that my Lego projects are my primary hobby, however book reading is easily number two. I read a ton of books, and I really like watching movies.  occasionally play video games, I really like them but rarely have the time to, I also really enjoy doing pencil drawings, but that is something else that I don't do very often unfortunately.
                                        </p>
                                        <h1>7. What are your favorites (music, movies, books, etc.)?</h1>                                            
                                            
                                        <p>I read mostly High Fantasy or Epic Fantasy.  My favorite series is The Wheel of Time, and I really like all of Brandon Sanderson's books.  I also really like Lord of the Rings, Narnia, and A Song of Ice and Fire.  As far as movies, I like a large variety, but my favorite has to go to Star Wars.</p>
                                        <h1>8. What's an aspect of the LEGO community that you would want to change?</h1>
                                            
                                        <p>The Lego community is fantastic and overall great.  It has its faults and shortcomings, but overall is very good.  If I could change one thing, it is the concept that a build isn't 'cool' or worth doing unless it is the first, biggest, or best.  I've seen a lot of people say, "I'd like to build (such-n-such), but I wouldn't be able to make it as (well or big or whatever.)" Have fun with the organized competitions in the community, but we don't need to be competitive all the time, we are here to have fun right?</p>
                                       <h1>9. What is your favorite MOC that you’ve built? Or the one you’re most proud of?</h1>                                            
                                            
                                        <p>My favorite MoC of mine, right now is probably my Tomb Raider build.  I really liked being able to pull off only one fig in such a large build.  It captures that player vs. environment feel of the game well.  I am extremely satisfied with the power functions too.  It was quite a challenge to get the waterfall to operate as quickly as it does, but it was worth it.

                                        <h1>10. Do all your friends/family know you build with LEGO as a hobby? Or is it something that has never come up in a conversation?</h1>

                                        <p> I am very public with my Lego hobby, everyone who knows me personally, knows this is a major hobby of mine.  Grandparents are always asking if I have any new competitions coming, and friends are always tagging me in Lego related posts they see.</p>
