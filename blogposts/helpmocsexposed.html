                                        <h2>Help, Where do I get my MOCs Exposed</h2>
                                            <p>How do you guide more people to discovering your MOCs?</p>
                                            <h1>4/14/17</h1>
                                        </header>
                                        <p>You’ve put hours, cumulatively maybe even days, into this MOC. You want to share it on the Internet so hopefully more people can see your work. But how do you guide more people to discovering your MOCs? Some might say it’s all “simple tricks and nonsense,” but for others there seems to be a rhyme or reason. Although my knowledge isn’t on par with masters of clickbait and Internet manipulists, I’m going to throw in my two cents.</p>
                                        <p>Upon finally finishing your incredible build, it’s understandable how antsy one can be to post to the world wide web. Once you’ve taken some ‘meh’ photos, maybe a video, and drop them on social media you go to sleep or standby waiting to comments to roll in. But trust me, waiting it out and putting in proper effort is easily worth the wait of an extra day. I’ve personally seen great work essentially go down the drain simply due to rushing out a garbage video and quickly taking poor photos. After making loads of MOCs I understand the effort required in the final stage, being the video.</p>
                                        <p>I finished the Death Trooper helmet MOC some time in the evening of a Friday night. Over the next few hours I cleaned and prepared my room to film the video before starting around 10 PM. Even though I was working as hard as I could and it only turned out to be a 2 minute long showcase, only around 3 AM did I complete the work with the camera. Editing lasted till 8 AM, with the timestamp on the publishing reading “8:35 AM.” Keep in mind this still includes taking a nice thumbnail picture and photos for Flickr. At the time it was a ton of work, but looking back, it was worth it. I very much like the result and based on the response, folks enjoyed not only the MOC, but the video also.</p>
                                        <p>Everyone has their own style and of course I’m not telling you to pull an all nighter to complete a video for your channel, but as long as the visual quality is there to present your build and entertain the masses, you can move on to step two.</p>
                                        <p>There are so many places you can post this newly completed masterpiece of yours, where to start? Begin with your initial platform of choice: your homebase. For example, mine is YouTube; Flickr, Instagram, and Reddit all redirect and support my YouTube. Once that jumping off point has been established, you can, in essence, spam all platforms on the face of the Internet, although it may not be totally necessary. While I only use the aforementioned places because of the large pre-existing communities residing on them, there are even more options. Other RebelLUG members browse Facebook, MOCPages, and even Twitter for new builds.</p>
                                        <p>The hardest part however is finding and being found by the community of LEGO people hiding on these social media sites. To solve this problem, many such as Flickr or Facebook have group features where the ecosystem is much smaller and all fellow LEGO fans. Not only will this help you find cool MOCs, it subsequently leads other enthusiasts to you.</p>
                                        <p>Now that all those other social medias are pointing towards on primary place where you choose to call home, it’ll be able to grow. Of course there’s no single formula, but I hope this helps you find a starting point if you’re still looking for it.</p>
